Event4u is a web application that allows users to find the perfect event for themselves. The app allows users to search for events in a variety of categories that might be of interest to them and that are near their location. Users can sign up and create a profile to get other options such as creating events, marking events with going to or interested parties, subscribing to other users and getting notifications, etc.

### Pre-running requests

- You can run the services either `locally` or with `docker`
- Based on your running choice, you need to change the `.env` files accordingly to the services
- All services have a `README.md` in their root path with an explanation on how to set up the `.env` file 

### Running with docker

- To run with docker, you must have docker installed and started
- If running on `windows` please change all `.sh` files so that the `EOL` format is `LF` and not `CRLF`, otherwise the services won't start !
- Finally run:

```shell script
docker-compose up --build
```
